# Zach Smith Assignment 5 



Descriptions and Links 

[Question 1](https://editor.p5js.org/zachary.w.smith/sketches/r8deFCKOh): I decided to make the backround an underwater color and made the bubbles look like bubbles using 3 ellipses. The bubbles are made using a class and also accept x , y , and radius arguments.  


[Question 2](https://editor.p5js.org/zachary.w.smith/sketches/rPNTJB7DL): Using an array and two for loops, one loop that increments the array and another that draws the bubbles using the bubble class. I also added some logic from lab 9 that keeps the bubbles on the canvass. So far I dont really like how this is turning out and I'll probably change how it looks for the final version.
