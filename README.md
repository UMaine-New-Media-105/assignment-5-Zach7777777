# Zach Smith Assignment 5 



Descriptions and Links 

[Question 1](https://editor.p5js.org/zachary.w.smith/sketches/r8deFCKOh): I decided to make the backround an underwater color and made the bubbles look like bubbles using 3 ellipses. The bubbles are made using a class and also accept x , y , and radius arguments.  


[Question 2](https://editor.p5js.org/zachary.w.smith/sketches/rPNTJB7DL): Using an array and two for loops, one loop that increments the array and another that draws the bubbles using the bubble class. I also added some logic from lab 9 that keeps the bubbles on the canvass. So far I dont really like how this is turning out and I'll probably change how it looks for the final version.


[Question 3](https://editor.p5js.org/zachary.w.smith/sketches/2XOKrF35O): Added the breeders and the catchers but they don't breed or catch yet. To make the game a little more interactive I decided to make it so the user directly controls the ammount of red squares by clicking the box on the left. In the final version they will hopefully despawn after 3 hits off of the wall. Also I added the border to make it feel more like a game/simulator thingy with bolts and whatnot. Also spawning in red sqaures uses the health and eating bacteria will increase the health bar, so you can spawn as meny squares as you want but they have to eat bacteria so you can keep spawning squares. The bacteria also need to multiply when they touch in a future version.


[Question 4](https://editor.p5js.org/zachary.w.smith/sketches/v3-iPE-ff): Made the breeders work, they have to multiply quickly to be able to keep up with the squares, I think it would be harder to make the squares slower rather then the breeders fast so. 

[Question 5(https://editor.p5js.org/zachary.w.smith/sketches/0dC7sxUuj): Finished the game
